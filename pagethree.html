                        <h2>A chic geek sport emerges for the smart, pudgy, pale, and rich.</h2>

                        <p>What do billionaire geeks do for sport? They play polo. On segways.
                Segway polo works a lot like regular polo, except instead of riding horses, the players are on Segways, and instead of evoking glamorous images of a centuries-old aristocratic tradition, the players are on Segways. Billed as the invention that would change the course of mankind when it was unveiled in 2001, the Segway has instead fallen into more of a niche market, used primarily for tour groups and the tech-obsessed.
                The sport has begun to take off--or at least roll slowly apparently defying gravity--growing from an eight-team local bay area tournament to a World Cup. The Segway Polo World Cup features nine teams from five countriesâ€”Germany, Sweden, the United States, Lebanon, and Barbados.
                The winner receives a trophy called the Woz Cup, in honor of the sport's creator, former Apple computer guru Steve Wozniak.  A collision in Segway polo is tantamount to a low-speed car crash, with little more than a helmet to protect you. But if Segway Polo has the violence of traditional sports, its appeal is still limited to the select group of people who already own Segways.</p>

                        <p>File this under curious. 58-year-old oil investor Richard Gibson has a peculiar collection. For the past 36 years, he has been religiously saving all his toenail clippings in a glass jar. At parties, he must be a real fun guy. Collecting toenails is a strange hobby, but Richard says that he did not exactly plan for it it sort of happened as a result of his <s>compulsion</s> curiosity, and he just never stopped. He happened to be clipping his nails one day in February, 1978, and instead of throwing them out, he just put them in a manicure box. He then started doing it repeatedly, just to see how long it would take to fill up the box. That did not take too long only two years and by then he was pretty much hooked. So he moved his collection to a large glass jar, which is what now uses to put the clippings in. I have no idea how many nails are in the jar, Gibson admitted. It is well into the thousands.  I will probably put them into something else, he said. I have got enough room for several more months worth of nails. It has not been easy to keep up the collecting. Richard has had to hide the jar from his ex-wife and from visitors for several weeks at a time, but, against all odds, he has kept his menagerie safe and his collection growing.</p>

                        <h2>It takes guts to make beer</h2>

                        <img src="images/beerbelly3x4.png" alt="beerbelly" title="beer belly">
                        <p>This medical case gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "beer gut." A 61-year-old man with a history of home-brewing stumbled into a Texas emergency room complaining of dizziness. Nurses ran a Breathalyzer test and found the man's blood alcohol concentration was a whopping 0.37 percent, or almost five times the legal limit for driving in Texas. There was just one hitch: The man said that he hadn't touched a drop of alcohol that day.
                        He would get drunk out of the blue on a Sunday morning after being at church, or really, just anytime, says Barabara Cordell, the dean of nursing at Panola College in Carthage, Texas. "His wife was so dismayed about it that she even bought a Breathalyzer." Other medical professionals chalked up the man's problem to "closet drinking." But Cordell and Dr. Justin McCarthy, a gastroenterologist in Lubbock, wanted to figure out what was really going on. So the team searched the man's belongings for liquor and then isolated him in a hospital room for 24 hours.

The 37-year-old man was wanted by police because he had been ordered to pay a $900 fine or face 71 days in jail for resisting arrest. The man, who ironically has only one arm himself, was easily recognized by two officers at the casino. Police said they approached him and were about to make the arrest when he "started beaming all of a sudden." The man had just won a $1,268 jackpot, allowing him to pay his fine on the spot.</p>

                        <h2>German police alerted to armed mob, find asparagus pickers</h2>
                        <h3>by Viola Fuss | 27th October 2016</h3>
                        <p>Police in rural northeastern Germany rushed out to track down a reported mob of up to 15 people armed with knives and sticks. Instead, they found a group of asparagus harvesters.
                        Police in the town of Ludwigslust said a man called their emergency number Saturday to report having seen "10 to 15 people armed with knives and sticks" on a local road. Within minutes, six police cars were on their way to the scene. Officers quickly discovered, however, that the group was asparagus harvesters walking along the road with their work tools as they went to take a lunch break. 
                        White asparagus is a popular delicacy in Germany and a ubiquitous sight on restaurant menus in late spring.</p>

                        <h2>Man convicted of driving Zamboni drunk at hockey game</h2>
                        <h3>by I. C. Ice | 27th October 2016</h3>
                        <p>A Fargo man who admitted being drunk while operating a Zamboni during a high school hockey game was convicted Tuesday after the judge rejected his lawyer s argument that the ice-resurfacing machine didn t meet the definition of a vehicle under city code.Lewis Cannon, 27, was sentenced to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served, and ordered a $1,500 fine, chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state s 24/7 sobriety program.He was arrested in January during a girls hockey game after witnesses complained he was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashing into the boards. Police say his blood-alcohol content was nearly four times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle.Defense attorney Sue Furst said during the bench trial Tuesday that the law is not clear whether a Zamboni is considered a vehicle, or whether it is illegal to drive the machine on the ice while drunk. But Municipal Court Judge Xavier Breath said state law is written to include vehicles "such as" a Zamboni. Afterward, Furst said her research of DUI law found specific vehicles such as tractors, snowmobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, but she found no references to a Zamboni. Cannon, who declined to comment after the hearing, apologized to the court and said he has been sober since the incident. "I feel I have been going around in circles, now I just want to start the next period of my life," he said.</p>

                        <p>New Jersey officials smell something fishy. There have been some incredible animal rescues from the elements, but the City of Newark s Department of Health and Community Wellness warned New Jerseyans today not to catch or eat fish that may have scavanged after the recent storms.
                        In Newark, heavy rain and flooding has caused fish to swim out of overflown rivers. Some locals are placing them back to their homes while others see this as an opportunity for dinner.
                        Department of Health spokeswoman Elle R. Highwater told reporters, "Hey. These are New Jersey rivers. Would you drink the water out of these rivers? If not, why would you eat fish that drink that water?"</p>

                        The Traverse City Record-Eagle reports when man, who had been drinking like a marlin, showed up Tuesday morning workers called police. Officers found the 48-year-old man a quarter mile down the pike flipping off passing drivers. Captain Crook of the Traverse City PD says the man was tanked. He was not arrested, but warned not to surface again at the restaurant.
                        Crook couldn t fathom why the man was wearing scuba gear.
