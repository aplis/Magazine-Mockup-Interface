                        <p>The weather-obsessed British spend on average six months of their lives talking about whether it's going to rain or shine, according to a survey published recently.
                Speculation about whether it's going to be wet, complaints about the cold and murmurings about the heat are also the first points of conversation with strangers or colleagues for 58% of Britons, the survey found. The study of 2,018 adults by pollsters found Britons talk about the weather for more than two days [49 hours] every year; the subject comes up more often than work, what is on television, sport, or gossip
                Nineteen percent of over 65s questioned also believe they can predict the weather as well as a professional weatherman.The most likely explanation for the British fascination with weather is that the food is so boring, they have to find something else to discuss.</p>

                        <h3>by Levon Hold</h3>

                        <p>If you are worried about your smartphone addiction, then the new WhyPhone might be just what you need. It is the perfect mobile placebo that it looks and feels exactly like an iPhone, but it does nothing. It is just a piece of plastic that you carry around in your hand to fool yourself.
                With a thin, light and completely wireless design, the WhyPhone acts as a surrogate to any smart mobile device, enabling you to always have a rectangle of smooth, cold plastic to clutch without forgoing any potential engagement with your direct environment.
                iPhone addiction is real, says developer Ima Luddite. It is ruining your dates. It is distracting you at concerts. It is enabling your drunk texting. It is clogging up our sidewalks." Speed chugging 200 marshmallows includes ingesting a whole lot of air.
                The WhyPhone is 5.5 inches high, 2.6 inches wide and 0.29 inches thick, bringing it quite close to the latest iPhone 6. It is shatterproof and waterproof. It offers infinite battery life. And it comes with a license offering free software upgrades for the life of the phone.
                For those interested in WhyPhone, but concerned about no longer being able to take nude selfies, WhyPhone is available with an optional mirror sticker so you can enjoy â€˜real-timeâ€™ selfies with your friends when theyâ€™re standing right behind you.</p>

                        <p>Matt Stoner doesn't say much. But if you can eat it, Matt Stoner can eat more of it.
                Matt doesn't give interviews prefering silence to keep his mouth in training for tournement. And, in recent savory competitions, Matt's training regimen has paid off. He has downed five Big Macs in under a minute, inhaled 120 Chicken McNuggets in 90 seconds, and then quaffed a two liter bottle of coke without letting out so much as a burp.
                During this week's "Stay Puft Marshmellow Man Match Meet" at Mammoth Cave, silent Matt broke his own record scarfing down 200 marshmellow peeps in 2:21 before the atmosphere turned foul. Speed chugging 200 marshmallows includes ingesting a whole lot of air. And, inside a distended body, that gas needs a way to escape. Fast.
                Matt won the meet, besting his second place by whopping 17 seconds. But ironically Matt, who had been hoping to finish the peep show without making one, was anything but silent throughout the awards ceremony.And, in recent savory competitions, Matt's training regimen has paid off.

                        <p>Success is sweet, but can a sweet predict success? Or will this gambler get his just desserts?
                A college lecturer in Andover, United Kingdom, reportedly saw what he believed to be the face of golfer Rory McIlroy on a cheese Danish and bet $1,700 on him to win the Masters. "It is got to be a sign -- Rorys face on a piece of food from his girlfriends home country," Rob Price told British news site The Independent. "My mates had a giggle and think I am mad, but if I pocket [$20,000], I will be the one laughing." Prior to the tournement Price tweeted news of his wager and posted a picture of confection.
                In the end nothing could be cruller: McIlroy finished eighth at the Masters and Price was toast. His girlfriend ventured there were several things $1,700 might better have been spent on than an ill-considered pastry play.</p>

                        <h2>German police alerted to armed mob, find asparagus pickers</h2>
                        <h3>by Viola Fuss | 27th October 2016</h3>
                        <p>Police in rural northeastern Germany rushed out to track down a reported mob of up to 15 people armed with knives and sticks. Instead, they found a group of asparagus harvesters.
                        Police in the town of Ludwigslust said a man called their emergency number Saturday to report having seen "10 to 15 people armed with knives and sticks" on a local road. Within minutes, six police cars were on their way to the scene. Officers quickly discovered, however, that the group was asparagus harvesters walking along the road with their work tools as they went to take a lunch break. 
                        White asparagus is a popular delicacy in Germany and a ubiquitous sight on restaurant menus in late spring.</p>

                        <h3>by I. C. Ice | 27th October 2016</h3>
                        <p>A Fargo man who admitted being drunk while operating a Zamboni during a high school hockey game was convicted Tuesday after the judge rejected his lawyer s argument that the ice-resurfacing machine didn t meet the definition of a vehicle under city code.Lewis Cannon, 27, was sentenced to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served, and ordered a $1,500 fine, chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state s 24/7 sobriety program.He was arrested in January during a girls hockey game after witnesses complained he was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashing into the boards. Police say his blood-alcohol content was nearly four times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle.Defense attorney Sue Furst said during the bench trial Tuesday that the law is not clear whether a Zamboni is considered a vehicle, or whether it is illegal to drive the machine on the ice while drunk. But Municipal Court Judge Xavier Breath said state law is written to include vehicles "such as" a Zamboni. Afterward, Furst said her research of DUI law found specific vehicles such as tractors, snowmobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, but she found no references to a Zamboni. Cannon, who declined to comment after the hearing, apologized to the court and said he has been sober since the incident. "I feel I have been going around in circles, now I just want to start the next period of my life," he said.</p>

                        <p>New Jersey officials smell something fishy. There have been some incredible animal rescues from the elements, but the City of Newark s Department of Health and Community Wellness warned New Jerseyans today not to catch or eat fish that may have scavanged after the recent storms.
                        In Newark, heavy rain and flooding has caused fish to swim out of overflown rivers. Some locals are placing them back to their homes while others see this as an opportunity for dinner.
                        Department of Health spokeswoman Elle R. Highwater told reporters, "Hey. These are New Jersey rivers. Would you drink the water out of these rivers? If not, why would you eat fish that drink that water?"</p>

                        The Traverse City Record-Eagle reports when man, who had been drinking like a marlin, showed up Tuesday morning workers called police. Officers found the 48-year-old man a quarter mile down the pike flipping off passing drivers. Captain Crook of the Traverse City PD says the man was tanked. He was not arrested, but warned not to surface again at the restaurant.
                        Crook couldn t fathom why the man was wearing scuba gear.
