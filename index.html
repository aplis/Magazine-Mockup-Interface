                        <h3>by Anne T. Jemima</h3>
                        <img src="images/beatles3x4.png" alt="pancakeface" title="pancake artist">
                        <p>You can eat these eight days a week--or after a hard day's night. Artist Nathan Shields sketched the Beatles with pancake batter capturing the process in one rockin' video that recently went viral on YouTube. While Shields posted the video a several months ago, the viral attention continually renews like an influenza virus that keeps mutating.
                        Has his choice of medium impacting anything outside of his art? "I should have known better," explains Shields. "I've ate so many of my trial sketches and carry that weight." But Shields recently swore off consuming his drafts for a serious diet saying, "that was yesterday." "I'm a loser, he concluded in the end. You probably walk through the streets while texting and not paying attention to your surroundings only to whomever is chatting on your screen. This causes collisions with other pedestrians. You could, unknowingly, even walk right into your text mate. If pedestrian lanes are successful, Wander plans next year to propose a similar solution for texting drivers.</p>

                        <h2>Toe wrestling competitors put best foot forward</h2>
                        <h3>by Susan Sochs</h3>
                        <img src="http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBlaMBp.img?h=495&w=728&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1187&y=1420" alt="wrestling" title="wrestling">
                        <p>Draped in a Union Jack flag, Alan "Big Piggy" Nash retained his title last weekend as World Toe Wrestling Champion. The Derbyshire village of Boughringtown in northern England hosted the World Championship of Toe Wrestling last weekend in a competition that drew spectators of all ages for some serious toe-tussling.
                        Toe wrestling traces its roots to 1976 when Staffordshire pub landlord George Burgess sought to find a new sport for Brits to dominate, according to the Bentley Brook Inn where the championship took place. "I just love the fact that this is the one sport that England always win at, we get hammered at everything else," Nash said. "My technique ... is to hurt the first person that comes into the ring with me: hurt them bad and terrify everyone else."
                        There are two participants in each bout. With their feet on a small square ring on the floor, the competitors begin by locking their big toes together, before battling arm-wrestling style to drive their opponent s foot to the ground. Toe inspections are a must and mixed sex matches are, of course, not allowed.
                        There have been some dirty toed tactics,  flicking off  is one of them, organiser Edward Allington said. "If you know you re going to lose, if you pull your toe away then it s difficult for the referee to decide if it s accidental or deliberate."</p>

                        <h2>Exam season: Now with piglets!</h2>
                        <h3>by Ima Hogg</h3>
                        <img src="http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkpmak.img?h=182&w=270&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f" alt="piglets" title="piglets">
                        <p>This spring, Nottingham Trent University is looking to make exam season a little less painful and a lot more adorable for its students.
                        Members of NTU s student union have decided to create a piglet room for their fellow students to use to de-stress. Students are allowed to spend a few minutes interacting with the tiny swine, as well as baby goats, chicks, and even a donkey foal.
                        This ingenious idea is actually a fundraiser for a local guide dog organization. After the success of a similar puppy event last year, they decided to branch out.
                        It s been busy the entire two days, student union president Igor Beaver explained. "There s just a really good buzz around the campus." That buzz is spreading to the Internet as well, with the hashtag #PigletRoom taking over Twitter and Instagram.
                        Other universities around the United Kingdom have tried this tactic, too. The most popular option seems to be puppies, although Bath Spa University opted for Shetland ponies. Universities in the United States have followed suit, using everything from chickens to therapy cats in order to help students stay calm.</p>

                        <p>Eureka! After about a century of research, Swiss scientists have finally cracked the mystery of the holes in Swiss cheese.
                        Despite what you may have been told as a child, they are not caused by mice nibbling away inside cheese wheels. Experts from Agroscope, a Swiss centre for agricultural research, say the phenomenon -- which marks famous Swiss cheeses such as Emmental and Appenzell -- is caused by tiny bits of hay present in the milk and not bacteria as previously thought.
                        They found that the mystery holes in such cheeses became smaller or disappeared when milk used for cheese-making was extracted using modern methods. "It s the disappearance of the traditional bucket" used during milking that caused the difference, said Agroscope spokesman I.M. Shirley Wright, adding that bits of hay fell into it and then eventually cause the holes.</p>

                        <h2>German police alerted to armed mob, find asparagus pickers</h2>
                        <h3>by Viola Fuss | 27th October 2016</h3>
                        <p>Police in rural northeastern Germany rushed out to track down a reported mob of up to 15 people armed with knives and sticks. Instead, they found a group of asparagus harvesters.
                        Police in the town of Ludwigslust said a man called their emergency number Saturday to report having seen "10 to 15 people armed with knives and sticks" on a local road. Within minutes, six police cars were on their way to the scene. Officers quickly discovered, however, that the group was asparagus harvesters walking along the road with their work tools as they went to take a lunch break. 
                        White asparagus is a popular delicacy in Germany and a ubiquitous sight on restaurant menus in late spring.</p>

                        <h3>by I. C. Ice | 27th October 2016</h3>
                        <p>A Fargo man who admitted being drunk while operating a Zamboni during a high school hockey game was convicted Tuesday after the judge rejected his lawyer s argument that the ice-resurfacing machine didn t meet the definition of a vehicle under city code.Lewis Cannon, 27, was sentenced to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served, and ordered a $1,500 fine, chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state s 24/7 sobriety program.He was arrested in January during a girls hockey game after witnesses complained he was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashing into the boards. Police say his blood-alcohol content was nearly four times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle.Defense attorney Sue Furst said during the bench trial Tuesday that the law is not clear whether a Zamboni is considered a vehicle, or whether it is illegal to drive the machine on the ice while drunk. But Municipal Court Judge Xavier Breath said state law is written to include vehicles "such as" a Zamboni. Afterward, Furst said her research of DUI law found specific vehicles such as tractors, snowmobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, but she found no references to a Zamboni. Cannon, who declined to comment after the hearing, apologized to the court and said he has been sober since the incident. "I feel I have been going around in circles, now I just want to start the next period of my life," he said.</p>

                        <p>New Jersey officials smell something fishy. There have been some incredible animal rescues from the elements, but the City of Newark s Department of Health and Community Wellness warned New Jerseyans today not to catch or eat fish that may have scavanged after the recent storms.
                        In Newark, heavy rain and flooding has caused fish to swim out of overflown rivers. Some locals are placing them back to their homes while others see this as an opportunity for dinner.
                        Department of Health spokeswoman Elle R. Highwater told reporters, "Hey. These are New Jersey rivers. Would you drink the water out of these rivers? If not, why would you eat fish that drink that water?"</p>

                        The Traverse City Record-Eagle reports when man, who had been drinking like a marlin, showed up Tuesday morning workers called police. Officers found the 48-year-old man a quarter mile down the pike flipping off passing drivers. Captain Crook of the Traverse City PD says the man was tanked. He was not arrested, but warned not to surface again at the restaurant.
                        Crook couldn t fathom why the man was wearing scuba gear.
